# Smoking-Prediction

This project aims to predict smoking status (smoker or non-smoker) based on various health and demographic factors using multiple machine learning models. The models were developed, trained, and evaluated using a dataset that includes features such as gender, oral health, and tartar presence.

## Overview

The dataset contains health and demographic information used to predict smoking status.
It includes features such as ID, gender, oral health, tartar presence, and other health-related metrics.

## Project Structure

- `script.py`: Main script containing the implementation of data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `smoking.csv`: Dataset file used for model training and testing.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Includes data visualization and preprocessing steps.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compares performance of multiple algorithms using cross-validation.
- **Data Standardization**: Improves model accuracy by standardizing the dataset.

## Results

The project achieved a mean accuracy of 96.3% using the SVM model after standardizing the data. Performance metrics and comparison plots are generated for each model.

## Dependencies
